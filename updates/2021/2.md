### 👍 What's New with 2021/2 commit
There's nothing with this commit, no new features, no UI updates, as the title says, .DS_Store is annoying to me when it updates many times a day without any code update. New features or UI updates coming soon.

**List of changes:**
- Added .gitignore to ignore the changes of .DS_STORE
